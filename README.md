A project I am working on to examine the sentiment of stocks on Twitter in real time.

Used Sci-kit learn to train machine learning models to recognize setminents of tweets (with ~80% accuracy).

Created Python script to scrape Twitter based on stock tickers using snscrape and pipe data through ml models. Upload resulting data to firebase database.

Implement Flask API to retrieve data from Firebase to be served to front-end.

Plan to implement a front-end using Vue to visualize the data.
